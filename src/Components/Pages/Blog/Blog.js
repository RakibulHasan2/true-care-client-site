            <p>SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.SQL databases represent massive communities, stable codebases, and proven standards. Multitudes of examples are posted online and experts are available to support those new to programming relational data.At a high level, SQL and NoSQL comply with separate rules for resolving transactions. RDBMSs must exhibit four “ACID” properties:</p>

            <h3 className='font-bold text-2xl'>Question-02 :What is JWT, and how does it work?</h3>
            <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language.Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website. NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. 2. Javascript can only be run in the browsers.To summarize, Node. js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for servers and applications. It is built on a single-threaded, non-blocking event loop, the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, and a low-level I/O API</p>

            <h3 className='font-bold text-2xl'>Question-04 : How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h3>
            <p> NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.As is, node. js can process upwards of 1000 requests per second and speed limited only to the speed of your network card. Note that it's 1000 requests per second not clients connected simultaneously. It can handle the 10000 simultaneous clients without issue. </p>
